# deep-learning-journey
Hands-on deep learning from first principles.   From perceptrons to CNNs — all built, trained, and tested from scratch.

# Deep Learning Journey  
A continuously evolving repository documenting my hands-on learning of Deep Learning concepts, architectures, and experiments — starting from perceptrons and backpropagation, all the way to CNNs, and PyTorch models.

This repo is structured as **concept → implementation → experiment** so that each topic is not just theory, but supported by code notebooks, visual explanations, and results.

## 📌 Contents Overview

| Topic | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Perceptron** | Basic building block of neural networks — implemented from scratch using Python & NumPy. |
| **Backpropagation** | Step-by-step derivation and full manual implementation of weight updates. |
| **Activation Functions** | Comparison of Sigmoid, Tanh, ReLU, Leaky ReLU, Softmax + their derivatives & role in training. |
| **Vanishing Gradient Problem** | Why deep networks fail to train without proper activations & initialization. |
| **Wrong Weight Initialization** | Shows how bad initialization destroys learning; includes demo experiments. |
| **Pooling Layers** | Max vs Average pooling with visual examples. |
| **LeNet-5 Architecture** | Implementation of LeNet-5 on MNIST to understand early CNN design. |
| **PyTorch** | Beginner-to-intermediate PyTorch notebooks (Tensors, Autograd, Perceptrons). |
| **PyTorch-Projects** | Full model training experiments (ANN, CNN, Hyperparamneter Tuning). |
